# CTF-Auto-Scanner

## What does it do?
It scans a host, automatically determines a few services and scans them too.

<br>To learn stuff i kinda need a purpose. Since i do many ctf's i figured why not code something alongside that automates some of the stuff i do.
Apart from testing im not really even using it myself.
